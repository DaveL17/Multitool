### TODO

- Consider consolidating all report output to a single method. This may be more work than it's worth due to the
  various columnar reports with different layouts.
- Standardize report heading formats to look like last successful comm.
- Consider reorganizing menu items to put like items together. For example, group all the report tools together.
