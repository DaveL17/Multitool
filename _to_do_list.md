### TODO
- Consider combining like tools. For example, as was done with "Device Dictionary" and "Device Directory".
- Add battery level monitor script to an action item.
- Add a plugin action with a return value of all valid object types in a tuple so that developers
  can call the action for testing.

FIXME - installed plugins list > if a plugin is missing its .plist file, it breaks the report. Consider trapping and returning a warning
message.
