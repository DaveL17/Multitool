An eclectic set of tools and reports for the Indigo Home Control Server.

#### Usage
  The Multitool Plugin uses individual plugin menu items to access an 
  array of tools to do such things as print server status information 
  to the log, or "Object Dictionary" which prints information about the 
  selected object (action, device, etc.)

  When installed, the plugin does not use any Indigo system resources 
  unless called upon by the user.  The plugin may require access to the 
  Internet depending on the tool used; however, many functions of the 
  plugin do not require it.
