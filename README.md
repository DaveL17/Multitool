An eclectic set of tools and reports.

#### Installation
To install this plugin, you must have direct control of
your Indigo Server locally or through a VPN or screen
share.  Simply double-click on the Multitool.indigoPlugin
file and the plugin will be automatically installed (if
the Indigo Server is running).

#### Usage
The Multitool Plugin uses individual plugin menu items
to invoke things like "About Indigo" which prints server
status information to the log, or "Object Dictionary"
which prints the valuesDict for the selected object
(action, device, etc.)

Notes: The Multitool plugin does not require Internet access in 
order to work, but the plugin does require Internet access to check
for plugin software updates.  These features are not required to 
use the plugin.
